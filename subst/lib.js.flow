// From lib.es5.d.ts, `interface PromiseLike<T>` is just like `Promise`,
// but with only `then` and no `catch` or `finally` etc; and with `then`
// returning another PromiseLike.
//
// Then the way that's used is that the callback arguments to `then` -- both
// versions of it -- as well as to some other things like `Promise.any` and
// some Node methods, are only required to provide a `T | PromiseLike<T>`,
// not `T | Promise<T>`.
//
// In flowlib, `then` and `Promise.allSettled` take `T | Promise<T>`.  So
// just alias PromiseLike to Promise.
export type { Promise as PromiseLike };

// TODO: Extract; then that covers the integration suite!
