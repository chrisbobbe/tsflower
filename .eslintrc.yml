# Tips for developing on this file:
#
#  * To see what config currently applies, try a command like:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/convert.ts | less
#
#    or for a specific rule:
#
#      $ npx eslint --print-config src/convert.ts | jq '.rules["indent"]'
#
#    Especially handy for seeing the default or base setting, when we don't
#    configure a rule ourselves.
#
#  * A variation to canonicalize the config output for comparison:
#
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/foo.ts | jq . --sorted >/tmp/foo.json
#     $ npx eslint --print-config src/bar.ts | jq . --sorted >/tmp/bar.json
#     $ git diff --no-index /tmp/{foo,bar}.json
